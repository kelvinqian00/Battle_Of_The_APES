<html><u>Battle of the APES: Intro</u>

The objective of 'Battle of the APES is to confront an environmental villain with super strength, 
super health, and so forth, while all you have is a proverbial hammer. However, by demonstrating your 
knowledge in the field of Environmental Science, you can strengthen yourself to be more than a match
against the enemy. Except the enemy is smart and cunning, so...

<u>Controls</u>

Most of the game is played with the mouse. However, there are two keyboard shortcuts: 
<ul>
<li>Enter: Press in lieu of clicking the "Continue" button at the bottom. 
<li>Esc: Brings up the Options menu, where you can save the current turn or exit. 
</ul>
<u>Starting Up</u>

The game picks a random enemy for you to fight against. Meanwhile you have the same stats against each 
enemy, which will force you to use different strategies to fight each one. The only thing you can 
change is your name, which you enter when you start a new game.

<u>Player and Enemy Stats</u>

You start with a certain maximum amount of hitpoints, an attack strength, and a certain amount you 
can heal by. The enemy also starts with a certain amount of hitpoints (though unlike the player, they 
have no upper limit), an attack strength, and a particular heal amount.

The enemy also has a 'super attack' that can inflict significantly more damage than their regular 
attack, so watch out!

<u>What a Turn Looks Like:</u>

One turn consists of the following:
<ul>
<li>You choose an action, e.g. attack the enemy.
<li>If it's a 'basic action,' you'll see their effects directly.
<li>If it's an 'advanced action,' you'll have to answer a question; if you answer correctly, you can 
proceed with said action.
<li>The enemy makes their move.
<li>Rinse and repeat.
</ul>
<u>Basic Player Actions</u>

There are three basic actions you, as the player, can do: 
<ul><li>Attack: When you attack, you reduce the enemy's hitpoints by your attack strength, e.g. if 
your attack strength is 500 and you attack, the enemy has 500 less hitpoints than they started with.
<li>Heal: When you heal, you increase your own hitpoints by your heal amount, e.g. if your heal 
amount is 500, then your hitpoints increase by 500 points.
<li>Random Attack: You deal a random amount of damage, ranging from 0 to twice your regular attack 
strength.
</ul>

<u>Advanced Player Actions</u>

There are also three advanced actions you can do: increase your maximum hitpoints cap, increase your 
attack strength, or increase your heal amount. They are "advanced" because there's an extra step: you 
have to answer a multiple-choice question correctly in order to level up.

In general, these questions will be actual AP Environmental Science exam questions or be reflective 
of such questions. Thus if you do not have sufficient knowledge about APES subject matter, you are 
screwed. If you choose the correct choice (there are 5), you can proceed with the action, such as 
increasing your attack strength. If you fail, then you cannot and the game proceeds to the enemy's 
action.

<u>Enemy Actions</u>

The enemy has a variety of actions at their disposal:
<ul>
<li>Attack: The enemy will attack the player, reducing the player's hitpoints by a certain amount. 
Said amount is slightly randomized, but is centered around the enemy's basic attack strength.
<li>Heal: The enemy will heal and increase the amount of hitpoints they have. Unlike the player, they 
have no maximum hitpoint cap. Like with their attack, the amount they heal by is slightly random. The 
probability that they'll heal depends on how close to death (i.e. 0 hitpoints) they are.
<li>Super Attack: The enemy can inflict this extra-strong attack on the player, which for each villain 
has a unique name. Other than the greater damage it causes, the super attack is functionally similar 
to the enemy's basic attack. The chance that they'll inflict the super attack increases the further 
the game progresses.
<li>Increase Attack: Occasionally, the enemy will increase the strength of both their regular and super 
attacks, by the original values of those two stats The chance of this happening increases with how stronger 
the player is compared to the enemy, e.g. if the player's attack strength is 750, the probability of the 
enemy doubling their strength is greater if their attack strength is 250 instead of 750.
<li>Increase Heal Amount: The enemy will occasionally increase the amount they heal by. Just like with 
doubling attack strength, the increase is by the original heal amount, and the chance of that happening 
increases if the ratio between the player's and enemy's heal amounts increases.
</ul>
<u>Endgame</u>

Obviously, the game ends if either the player or the enemy wins. The player wins if the amount of 
hitpoints the enemy has reaches 0; the player loses if their hitpoints reach 0.
